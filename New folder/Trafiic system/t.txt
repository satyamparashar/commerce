Sure, I understand that you want to create a traffic management system that helps manage traffic in the city more efficiently. The system would consider factors such as school timings, office hours, and shop schedules to guide people on when to travel. Additionally, you propose using incentives and deals to encourage people to travel during less congested times, like offering special deals that are only applicable at night to reduce daytime traffic. The system would utilize CCTV camera footage from traffic lights to analyze traffic conditions and also suggest route diversions. As an example, you mention that movie tickets at Pacific Mall would be cheaper at night compared to the daytime. This approach aims to reduce traffic congestion during peak hours.
